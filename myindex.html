      <p>
        My name is Yeisson Giraldo C. I am a biological engineer from the
        National University of Colombia. I am currently a data science and
        programming student. I have always liked critical thinking and that is
        why I love numbers. Once, I discovered how numbers have influenced the
        development of technology and how magnificent things can be created
        through computers, I became very interested in learning programming
        languages. My goal is to be better every day and contribute using my
        skills to improve and help industries and people.

        My experience is varied as I have worked in many fields. Professionally
        I worked with biofuels for some time then I moved out from my country.
        As a immigrant I have performance various jobs, from landscaping and
        driving 18-wheelers. I have gradually gained some experience in data
        analysis and interpretation. Tools like Excel and PowerBI I have been
        learning them with dedication and effort. languages like pyhton, html,
        and css are now part of my daily learning routine.
